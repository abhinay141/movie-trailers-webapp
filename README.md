This is a webpage that displays a web page of our favorite movie trailers ,the page contains the posters of the films ..when clicked upon plays
the trailer of that respective movie.
first the class was created for movies and different attributes were instantiated in the python file media.py.
in another python file entertainment_center.py the instances of the previous class are created.
note that all these python files should be present in the same folder
this allows us to make different copies of movies from the class Movie
create a list or array of all the instances that were created and store them in a variable
now, in the python file fresh_tomatoes.py there is this function called open_movies_page(),now pass the array of instances to this function as an argument ,this will open the webpage for all the instances created
after all this, finally save the program entertainment_center.py and run it.
